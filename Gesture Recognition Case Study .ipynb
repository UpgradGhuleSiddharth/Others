    "# Gesture Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement** - Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. In this group project, I am going to build 3D Conv and CNN-RNN models that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly."
